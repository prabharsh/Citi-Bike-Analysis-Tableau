During the period of Winter over 8 Million trips were recorded with the most occurring in before November 2022. Over all Trips die down as you move across this time period with an exception between January and February's numbers by 20259 rides

Overall Peak hours for the 2022 are between 2PM and 6PM. For this I included all months of 2022. The patter here follows that of day light during this time of year.

Looking at how average trip duration changes based on age you can see that there is a slight increase in ride time for those born 1996 - 2005 You can also see this for a few birth years in the 1940's and in 1969
